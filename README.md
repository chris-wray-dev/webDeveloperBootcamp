# webDeveloperBootcamp
Amanda Yu Udemy Course

A repo for the above course.  I have completed this course before but I'm using it as a refresher before I start bootcamp with https://northcoders.com/.  I will be committing as I complete each video which seems like a good way to learn and to keep all the resources and code together in one place.
